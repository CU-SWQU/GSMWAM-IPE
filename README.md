The Whole Atmosphere Model - Ionosphere, Plasmasphere, Electrodynamics (WAM-IPE) is
a model that extends the NOAA operational atmospheric weather codes into the thermosphere
and plasmasphere to provide upper atmosphere physics forecasts.

You can visit the [documentation website](https://swqu-gsmwam-ipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for information on how to build and run the model.
